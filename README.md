Used for managing one or more xbox live accounts in Minecraft PE / Bedrock 1.16.1X and earlier.

Optional Component for [mcpelauncher](https://github.com/minecraft-linux/mcpelauncher-manifest).

Xbox live integration of Minecraft Bedrock 1.16.20 and later is mostly handled inside the native game binary itself (official Xbox Authentication Library) and no longer requires this project.
